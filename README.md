* `$ nvm install 8` to install version 8 if necessary

##### Clone this boilerplate
```
$ git https://github.com/jwalters221/collab-react-ecom.git
```

##### and install the npm package:
```
$ npm install
```

## Start coding!

## Reactstrap Installation

##### Install reactstrap and peer dependencies via NPM
```

```

### Import required reactstrap components within src/App.js file or your custom component files:
```
import { Button } from 'reactstrap';
```

```
import {
  Carousel,
  CarouselItem,
  CarouselControl,
  CarouselIndicators,
  CarouselCaption
} from 'reactstrap';
```
### To Login you can use these 2 Users:

- `password: "1234"` 

User 2:

- `password: "5678"`
